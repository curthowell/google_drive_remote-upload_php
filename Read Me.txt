You need to signup for google cloud platform and enable google drive api and google people and google plus api.
You may need to enable to enable more apis.

After setting up and enabling your api on google ... download the secret.json and 
copy contents to 'client_secret.json' in root directory of installation.

Now you are good to go. 

Few More things:
1. Increase max execution time in php.ini
2. create a script which checks for files in files folder and delete files after some decay time. Because right now
the implementation of this script is not too good in deleting the files after completion of task. You also need to add that
script to cron, so that it will run automatically.

I will provide this script before 7 April, 2018 positively on faltutech.club
